# State Finder Web App

## Project Definition
Career transitions, job searching, and location searching are stressful activities that one usually encounters at some stage in their lives. Our State Finder Web Application is meant to aid people in these processes by creating a tool that will provide users with information that can help their decisions. The tool will mainly be targeted to those who are looking to move to another state, college students who want to see the locations that their future career could lead them to, people who are looking for a career change, or anyone that is curious about where an occupation could allow them to live in the United States. Our State Finder Web Application attempts to increase the confidence in the career choices and location choices one may make.
